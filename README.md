# Node Readme Generator!

## Description:
This project allows user to generate a clean README.md file for projects. This app allows users to spend more time on building & less time on formatting a description. Users, generate this file from the commandline using node.js, npm inquierer and their local computer's terminal.

## Instructions:
First, clone this repo to your local machine. Once you have the starter files needed, go to nodejs.org and download the LTS version of node.js. From there, while still in the root file of your project, type "npm init" (hitting enter or following the subsequent prompts) & "npm install inquirer." Add a .gitignore file to the root file, then type "node_modules" within the .gitignore file. Finally, head back to your terminal and type "node index" or "node index.js". You'll follow the prompts and voila! Once you complete the prompts a README.md file will generate in your dist folder. You're welcome!
